# Spielpendium - The Board Game Compendium

Spielpendium allows users to create a compendium of their
board games. A user can create their list by searching 
through BoardGameGeek's online catalog and adding games.
Additionally, if a user has a collection on BoardGameGeek,
they can import that list.

The name is a portmanteau of "spiel" (German for "game",
a reference to Germany's centrality in the board game 
sphere) and "compendium".
